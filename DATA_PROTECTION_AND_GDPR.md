# Data Protection and GDPR Compliance Statement

## 1. Privacy by Design
Harmonize is developed following privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default principles. The platform is configurable to allow institutions to apply their own data governance, access, and retention policies.

## 2. Lawful Basis for Processing
Harmonize does not determine the lawful basis for data processing. This responsibility lies with the implementing institution acting as Data Controller, in accordance with applicable laws.

## 3. Consent Management
Where consent is required, Harmonize supports:
- Recording consent-related metadata
- Managing access restrictions
- Enforcing data usage policies defined by the Data Controller

## 4. Data Minimization
Harmonize does not mandate the collection of personal data and supports data minimization by allowing institutions to define schemas, access levels, and retention rules.

## 5. Security and Confidentiality
Harmonize supports confidentiality and integrity of data through:
- Role-based access control
- User access control
- Logical separation of datasets
- Audit logs for data access and modifications

## 6. International Standards
Harmonize is designed to align with:
- EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management)
- ISO/IEC 27701 (Privacy Information Management)
